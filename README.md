If you want to execute these files 
go to Windows powershell and you'll find something along the lines of
C:\Users\[YOUR WINDOWS USERNAME]
so wherever this file is in i'd just put it in the folder of [YOUR WINDOWS USERNAME] and name it PythonLearning
and then do this to access it

cd C:\Users\[YOUR WINDOWS USERNAME]\PythonLearning
afterwards you can execute it by typing this in
python [script].py 

for ex

C:\Users\[MY USERNAME]\PythonLearning>python Tempature.py
then boom executed.
